1) Explain REST and RESTful
    - REST(Representational State Transfer) is an architecture and communication mode used in web developpment
    services with some characteristics : -client-server
                                         -stateless
                                         -cacheable
                                         -layered
                                         -Uniform Interface

    - RESTful is an architecture that allow client and server to communicate without
       knowing each other

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)
    - First of all for client/server communication we need HTTp ( for request and code returns)
    - (It's an option but very recommended is to use JSON, that makes data and
        information really easy to read and to treated, we can use XML too
    - Use Simple URI


3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
    - GET : request data from a resource in read-only mode (normally, we can use it differently but good result is not guarantee)
    - PUT | POST: send data to a server to create or update a resource
                  ( difference is that put target collections of resources
                    while pu target single resources)
    - DELETE: deletes specified resource
    - HEAD : Do the same thing as get but the response doesn't have body

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?
    - Stateless : Protocol that doesn't maintain state of latest HTTP request.
                  For it, each request, even if its the same each time, is new
    - Stateful : Opposite of Stateless
    HTTP is a stateless protocol

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)
    - GET : The parameters will be send directly via the url.This technique have clearly some limit
            because of that and less secure.
    - POST : Send parameters through the body and header
6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
    - I will search on the website (Stackoverflow, Github, etc..) and in the web in general
    - Ask to my collegues
    - Sometimes just walk or doing other thing during 5 minutes help me to find the answer
